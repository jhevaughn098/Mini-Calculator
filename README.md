# Mini-Calculator
 My first C++ project. Created a simple calculator. 
  <h1> <b> What I Learned </b></h1>
   <p> &#x2022; Utilized the standard library within. </p>
   <p> &#x2022; Math in C++ (operators): Using operators, I can easily calculate a given task</p>
   <p>&#x2022; Different kinds of Information (data types): I understand how to work with many data types like integers, float, and strings. </p>
   <p> &#x2022; Conditions: I learned that I can use switch statements instead of "if else" statements to make the code look cleaner.</p>
   <p> &#x2022; Printing on screen (cout) and Getting input (cin): Now I can display text on screen with cout and receive input from the user with cin. </p>
    <h1> <b> How to Use <b> </h1>  
      <p> 1. Run the script.</p>
      <p> 2. When it asks, provide which operations you like to do (+,-,*,/). </p>
      <p> 3. Input the first value, then the second value.</p>
      <p> 4. It gives your answer.</p>
        <h1> <b> Bug </b></h1>
          <p>&#x2022; If you input anything that's not an operator or number, it might get confused. </p>
            <h1> <b> Try it Out </b></h1>
               <p>1. You will first need an IDE or program to run C++ on your computer.</p>
               <p>2. Grab the script from my repository. </p>
               <p>3. Paste the script in your IDE and run it.</p>
               <p> Let me know what you think! </p>
